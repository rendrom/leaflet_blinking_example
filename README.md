This example shows the flashing of controls
with a large number of long-loaded layers in Google Chrome.
The number of layers after which blinks start differently on different computers.

To reproduce the error, wait a bit, then start interacting with the interface.
If flashing does not occur, try clicking on the Add Layer button.

You can try different versions of the leaflet.js, 
for this, uncomment/comment the appropriate scripts and styles in HEAD
